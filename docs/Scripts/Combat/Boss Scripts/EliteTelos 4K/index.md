## Frequently Asked Questions

:::

<ContentBlock title="Frequently Asked Questions">

> **Q1: The bot isn’t starting or freezes after launching.**  
> **Solution:** Check that you’ve met all equipment and inventory requirements. Missing a required item, action bar ability, or relics can cause the bot to stall, malfunction, die, or work incorrectly. Restart the bot after verifying your setup.

> **Q2: Bot stops unexpectedly or struggles to perform abilities.**  
> **Solution:** Ensure your in-game settings match the action bar and quick prayers setup. Any missing abilities or misconfigured action bar items will impact the bot’s effectiveness.

> **Q3: The bot isn’t using certain defensive abilities as expected.**  
> **Solution:** Verify that all defensives are placed on your action bar. Missing even one defensive on the bar can interrupt bot behavior, leading to death in-game.

> **Q4: No DPS increase despite having the recommended gear.**  
> **Solution:** Ensure your Archaeology Relics, Passives, and Farming totem perks are correctly equipped. Death Ward, Conservation of Energy, and Fury of the Small are required to meet DPS checks. If possible, ensure Reaper Crew is unlocked for maximum DPS.

> **Q5: I am missing certain item requirements. Can the bot work without them?**  
> **Solution:** The bot is optimized for the listed setup. While you can experiment, performance or stability issues may arise without the full list of equipment and unlocks.

> **Q6: The bot is not using Vulnerability Bombs properly or not at all.**  
> **Solution:** Double-check that Vulnerability Bombs are in your inventory and mapped to the action bar. Also, confirm that auto-retaliate is off, as it can interfere with some timed abilities.

> **Q7: Error related to missing runes or runes not being used.**  
> **Solution:** Make sure the Grasping Rune Pouches contain the required runes and that you have at least 16,000 of each in them to ensure an ample amount of time for runs. Errors and deaths can also occur if you accidentally deplete any essential runes mid-run.

> **Q8: Bot doesn’t seem to be summoning Blood Reaver or using Blood Siphon.**  
> **Solution:** Ensure that both Binding Contracts and Blood Reaver scrolls are available in your inventory.

> **Q9: Defensive abilities seem mistimed, leading to more deaths.**  
> **Solution:** Double-check that the Anachronia Totem Perk Armored is active. This boosts Barricade duration, essential for tanking Telos’s hits. Also, confirm that all aforementioned defensive abilities are on your action bar.

> **Q10: Bot doesn’t trigger the Deathguard Special Attack.**  
> **Solution:** Make sure the Essence of Finality Special Attack (Ability) is on the action bar. It’s needed for the Deathguard Special Attack to activate as expected.

> **Q11: The bot’s Quick Prayers aren’t activating as configured.**  
> **Solution:** Review your Quick Prayer setup in-game to ensure the combinations of Soul Split, Deflect Melee, Deflect Mage, and Ruination are mapped as shown. Incorrect settings will disrupt the prayer-switching mechanics. Additionally, make sure you drag quick prayers from the setup menu onto your action bar.
