## FAQ

:::
<ContentBlock title="FAQ">

**Q1**: Does it support all combat styles?  
**A1**: Yes, the script supports all combat styles. For **Necromancy**, you can use **Revolution+** while letting the bot utilize thresholds. For other combat styles, you’ll need to enable **Revolution++**.

**Q2**: What are the requirements for the Platypus safespot?  
**A2**: You need to complete the quest *As a First Resort* to unlock the Platypus and have **Level 20 Magic** to cast the **Bind Spell** (requires 1 nature rune per cast).  

**Q3**: I’m splashing the Bind Spell cast. What can I do?  
**A3**: Enable the *Wand Switch* option in the script UI and ensure you have any **wand** in your inventory. This improves the accuracy of the spell.

**Q4**: Is there an alternative to War’s Retreat teleport for banking?  
**A4**: Yes! You can enable *Randomized Banking*, which supports Edgeville, Burthorpe, and Taverly banks.

**Q5**: Can I still use the script if I don’t have a Zamorak Portal?  
**A5**: Yes! The script will create a group and use **Group Teleport** to reach the desired location.

**Q6**: Why aren’t my added abilities being detected?  
**A6**: Abilities and prayers are cached when the script loads. If you add or change abilities, click the **Reload Cache** button to update the script.

**Q7**: Why isn’t the script eating food, even though I have some in my inventory?  
**A7**: Ensure you have the **Eat Food** ability in your action bar. If it’s missing, add it and click **Reload Cache** (refer to Q6).
